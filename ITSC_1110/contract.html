    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>I, Gabi Heermann agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING 2025, ITSC 1110 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I
        understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
        available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
        for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my
        work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
        failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given
        the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
        or even view my classmates’ code directly. I will only use these resources to
        learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit and never from my classmates. 
        
        </p>
        <p><i>Signed: Gabi Heermann, 05/04/2005</i></p>
